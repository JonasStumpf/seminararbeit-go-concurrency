// The following code is an example in which Flow fuzzing is helpful.
// It consists of a mutex on which a TryLock is called. A TryLock only
// acquires a mutex, if the mutex is not locked already.
// In the given example, the TryLock operations is in most cases not successful
// since, given by the most likely execution times, it will be run while
// the mutex is held by the Lock. But it is still possible for the TryLock
// to be successful.
// If during a dynamic analysis, the TryLock is not, or never, successful,
// the analysis will never be able to execute the relevant code and detect
// the bug.
// By delaying the execution of the Lock operations, we may enable the TryLock
// to successfully acquire the mutex, making it possible for the analysis
// to detect the hidden bug.
